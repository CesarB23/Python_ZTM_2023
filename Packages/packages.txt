Packages are folders that contain modules
To import them we have to:
import folder.modules
Package folders must contain a __init__.py file 

If the package is inside a folder and again inside a folder
the shortest way to import is:
from folder.folder.package import function,function

To import all the functions from a module:

from module import *

Or to import with alias:
import module as alias

import random as rand
