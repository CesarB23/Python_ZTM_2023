4 pillars in which object oriented programming is based:
    -Encapsulation, is the process of creating the class with his own attributes and methods
    
    -Abstraction, call actions on the objects with out caring about how they are created, but 
    we gotta be carefull to only give access to certain features to avoid modifications in our programms

    -Inheritance ("Heredar"), thats how we assign properties from a class to another in order
    to dont repeat code, like creating parent and children classes

    -Polymorphism (Many forms), is the way we can assing kind of the same key-word methods
    to reuse code but it will not be modified in any of the istances
